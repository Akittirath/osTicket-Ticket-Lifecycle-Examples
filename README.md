<h1>osTicket - LifeCycle Examples Setup</h1>
</p>
This tutorial demonstrates the creation of tickets as an end user .<br />

We are now be having some fun creating some tickets to get an understanding of how the ticketing system works and looks like. Head over to localhost/osTicket/open.php. Create a new ticket and basically create a ticket with who is sending the ticket, the topic the problem is occurring in and the reason for it. This will open a ticket for the team to see and resolve together.

If we head back over to osTicket, we will see all the new tickets we have created under Karen and Ken. This is how it will look if you are a help desk technician and get a feel of what you will be doing.

The screenshot above, if you can see all the priority, Department, and status has not been changed. To change this, you will log into one of system admin accounts and break down each ticket with their SLA, who will be assigned what, priority and Dept that needs to take care of this ticket. Including text to each other knowing what is going on.
